__Title__: Qualcomm XR1 chip could bring faster, cheaper AR/VR to the enterprise  

__Summary__: The platform will also optimize for AI-powered AR experiences, and help with battery life.  

__GT text__: Qualcomm's new Snapdragon XR1 chip, announced via a Tuesday press release, aims to break down the barrier for high-quality virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and bring the technologies to lower-end devices.  
If successful, the XR1 chip could improve technologies found in modern smart glasses, and make VR and AR more affordable to get into for smaller companies. The chip could also help bring more artificial intelligence (AI) functionality into AR as well, the release noted.  
In its release, Qualcomm called the XR1 an Extended Reality (XR) platform, noting that it will help bring higher quality experiences to mass-produced devices. And the addition of the AI capabilities will provide "better interactivity, power consumption and thermal efficiency," the release said.

__GT Text__: Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:  
Individuals can get access to all of their data from a given firm, including their employer, by filing a subject access request.  
The GDPR will eliminate the cost for subject access requests and shorten the required response time from 40 days to 30.  
The May 25 deadline for the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is fast-approaching, and the coming changes will greatly shift the ability of companies to interact with customer data.  
Many people know the GDPR for its hard-line regulation around the "right to be forgotten," where an individual can request a company to erase the personal data it holds on them. However, it also contains the right to access any information that may be held by a company, including your employer.
