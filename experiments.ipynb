       "  'State and local police continued to be silent on the details of a fatal shooting of a man at local hotel by a Mankato police officer early Saturday, but family members are stepping forward to put a face to the man even as they seek more answers from authorities about why he died.\\nChase Anthony Tuseth, 33, who taught science, health and physical education at was the man who died in the shooting at Country Inn and Suites, according to Tuseth’s uncle, Mark Liptrap of Spokane, Wash.\\nThe Stewartville, Minn., native graduated from Minnesota State University and held a master’s degree in secondary-education/life science from St. Mary’s University in Minneapolis. He taught at Tokata Learning Center in Shakopee and lived in Eden Prairie.\\n“I’ve been talking to my sisters. … It’s really devastating,” Liptrap said in an interview with The Free Press. “… They’re pretty irritated with the police withholding all the information.”\\nLiptrap said his sister — Tuseth’s mother, Mickie Tuseth of Stewartville — wasn’t informed of her son’s death until 12 hours after he was killed by Mankato police responding to a report of a disturbance at the hotel on Mankato’s northeast side. While Liptrap doesn’t dispute the possibility that his nephew was intoxicated, he questions the necessity of using deadly force.\\n“Chase was just a great kid. He was quiet, just polite,” Liptrap said.\\nHis suspicion that Tuseth was drinking the night before his death is based on the fact that his car was found in downtown Mankato. Liptrap guesses that Tuseth came to Mankato to go out on the town with friends from his time at MSU, where he was a 2008 graduate and a high-jumper on the Maverick track team. He suspects that Tuseth took a cab or got a ride with friends to the hotel because he didn’t want to drive.\\nRelated Articles 22-year-old snowmobiler killed after he’s thrown, struck by another on North Shore\\nCheck your tickets!

It said that an altercation occurred, the officer shot the man and that efforts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful. The officer was treated at the Mankato hospital for unspecified injuries and released.\\nMankato police have referred all media questions to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating the shooting. Mankato police and the BCA have said that the identity of the dead man would be released by the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s office, and officials at the medical examiner’s office told The Free Press Saturday and again on Sunday that they do not release information to the media — referring questions to Mankato police and the BCA.\\nMinnesota state law allows police agencies to withhold certain information while investigations are active, but the law specifically requires other information to be made public even while the investigation continues. That public information includes the names of responding law enforcement officers, the name and age of the suspect, the names of witnesses including the person reporting the incident, a description of any resistance encountered by officers, the presence of weapons at the scene, the names and addresses of any victims or casualties, and “a brief factual reconstruction of events.”\\nA BCA official said Sunday that it could take “several days” for the agency to provide access to any of that additional information about the incident.\\nBased on recordings of police scanner traffic, The Free Press reported Saturday that the shooting occurred about five minutes after a desk clerk at Country Inn and Suites called 911 at 4:02 a.m. to report feeling threatened by a man behaving aggressively in the lobby of the hotel just northeast of Highways 22 and 14.\\nThe man, described in the recordings as 6-foot-5 and and bald, was reportedly throwing objects, including at the clerk. The first officer to reach the scene, based on the recordings, has a badge number of 3128, which belongs to veteran patrol officer Gary Schnorenberg.\\nEMTs reported the man suffered a gunshot wound to the left side with an exit wound on his back, according to the recordings.\\nLiptrap said family members “just don’t know enough,” including whether hotel security cameras captured the altercation.\\n“The big question everybody’s asking is ’Why didn’t they taser him?’ ” Liptrap said. “… This is so uncharacteristic of him.”\\nTuseth had a history of drinking and sometimes drinking heavily with friends, his uncle said. But he didn’t have a history of violence.\\n“I can’t say enough good about Chase,” Liptrap said. “But everybody has a dark side of some kind — Chase with the alcohol.”\\nBased on the statements of the desk clerk to the 911 dispatcher, Liptrap doesn’t doubt that Tuseth was creating a disturbance.\\n“I’m not saying Chase didn’t do anything wrong. He did, in effect,” he said. “But we think this is a case of excessive force. I mean, four shots? Come on.”\\nTuseth was recruited to the MSU track team as a high-jumper following success in Stewartville High School athletics that included all-state honors in track and all-conference honors in basketball. He graduated from Minnesota State in 2008 with a bachelor’s degree in ecology and biology.\\nAfter teaching English in Korea, he obtained his Minnesota teacher’s license in 2012 and taught at Watershed High School in Minneapolis and Integrated Arts Academy in Chaska before his current position.\\nHe is the son of Tony and Mickie Tuseth of Stewartville.',\n",

       "  'STARKE, Fla. — In an Oct. 5 story about the execution of a man in Florida, The Associated Press spelled the name of a city wrong. It is Fort Myers, not Fort Meyers.\\nA corrected version of the story is below:\\nFlorida has executed an inmate who was convicted of killing two people after a night of drinking decades ago.\\nMichael Lambrix, 57, died Thursday by lethal injection at 10:10 p.m. at Florida State Prison in Bradford County.\\nFor his final words, Lambrix said, \"I wish to say the Lord\\'s Prayer.\" He recited the words, ending on the line \"deliver us from evil,\" his voice breaking slightly at times.\\nWhen he finished and the drug cocktail began flowing through his veins, Lambrix\\'s chest heaved and his lips fluttered. This continues for about five minutes, until his lips and eyelids turned silver-blue and he lay motionless. A doctor checked his chest with a stethoscope and shined a light in both of his eyes before pronouncing him dead.\\nLambrix was the second inmate put to death by the state since it restarted executions in August.\\nBefore then, the state had stopped all executions for months after a Supreme Court ruling that found Florida\\'s method of sentencing people to death was unconstitutional. In response, the state Legislature passed a new law requiring death sentences to have a unanimous jury vote.\\nLambrix\\'s attorney, William Hennis, argued in an appeal to the nation\\'s high court that because his client\\'s jury recommendations for death were not unanimous — the juries in his two trials voted 8-4 and 10-2 for death — they should be thrown out. The Florida Supreme Court has ruled that Lambrix\\'s case is too old to qualify for relief from the new sentencing system.\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday night denied Lambrix\\'s last-ditch appeal.\\nLambrix was convicted of killing Clarence Moore and Aleisha Bryant in 1983 after a long night of partying in a small central Florida town, Labelle, about 30 miles (50 kilometres ) northeast of Fort Myers. Lambrix said he was innocent.\\nHe and his roommate, Frances Smith, had met the victims at a bar, and returned to their trailer to eat spaghetti and continue the party, prosecutors said.\\nAt some point after returning to the trailer, Lambrix asked Moore to go outside. He returned about 20 minutes later and asked Bryant to come out as well, according to Smith\\'s testimony.\\nSmith testified at trial that Lambrix returned to the trailer alone after the killings, his clothes covered in blood. The two finished the spaghetti, buried the two bodies and then washed up, according to Smith\\'s testimony cited in court documents.\\nProsecutors said Lambrix choked Bryant, and used a tire iron to kill Moore. Investigators found the bodies, the tire iron and the bloody shirt.\\nLambrix has claimed in previous appeals that it was Moore who killed Bryant, and that he killed Moore only in self- defence .\\n\"It won\\'t be an execution,\" he told reporters in an interview at the prison Tuesday, according to the Tampa Bay Times. \"It\\'s going to be an act of cold-blooded murder.\"\\nLambrix\\'s first trial ended in a hung jury. The jury in the second trial found him guilty of both murders, and a majority of jurors recommended death.\\nHe was originally scheduled to be executed in 2016, but that was postponed after the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s ruling in a case called Hurst v. Florida, which found Florida\\'s system for sentencing people to death was unconstitutional because it gave too much power to judges, instead of juries.\\nFlorida\\'s Supreme Court has ruled that the new death sentencing system only applies to cases back to 2002.\\nCorrections spokeswoman Michelle Glady said Bryant\\'s sister was the only victims\\' family member to attend the execution and she did not wish to speak with reporters afterward.\\n___',\n",

For my part, I wish to apologize.\\nFirst, through all of this I have allowed myself to become upset because of the accusations and demands that I know to be false. That is no excuse. I deeply wish that I had controlled my emotions better and ask your forgiveness.\\nSecond, I know that you have been offended by my CRP column and that you feel I was malicious in writing it. I can assure you that I wrote it with no ill will. My only objective was to shake people awake and help them see the truth of what they do to themselves, to their country, their children and to God. I pray that you will look again because the consequences of not finding and acting on the truth may be more than you want to bear. Either way, the choice is yours.\\nThird, I know that I tend to be quite blunt. Sometimes this is offensive to people. For that, I am also sorry.\\nI have done nothing to harm the church, harm it’s people, harm the valley or violate my covenants. I believe that every word I wrote was absolutely true, 100% verifiable and essential in our world of crumbling morality and decaying liberty. So while I do ask your forgiveness if you found my delivery abrasive, I do not and cannot apologize for the content. I hope you can understand.\\nAt this time, Mindy and I only desire is to retrieve my temple recommend and have our records moved to a ward where we will be accepted. At http://www.libertywrit.com/1/index.php/5/article/1797_–REG/The-Rockland-Letter, I have tried to document the many reasons why this has become necessary.\\nMindy and I only want to put Rockland behind us. Please support us in this effort.\\nI can’t begin to express the sorrow.\\nSincerely,\\nLance Earl\\nPrivate Message to Ladd Permann\\nLetter to the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\nBrother Lance Earl\\n2530 Big Canyon Road\\nRockland, Idaho 83271\\n208-317-9843\\nJune 28, 2016\\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\nOffice of the First Presidency\\n50 E. N. Temple\\nSalt Lake City, Utah 84150\\nDear Brethren,\\nIt is with a strange mix of hope and hopelessness that I write you today.\\nIt has been nearly a year since my Temple Recommend was taken, and still, I am unsure of what I am accused.\\nRecently, a beloved nephew, who will soon leave to serve a mission in Tonga, entered the Temple of the Lord for the first time. I longed to be with him. I ached to be with him.\\nBefore I explain the circumstances of my current predicament, please allow me to present a little background.\\nThere has been bad blood almost from the instant I moved to Rockland, Idaho some seventeen years ago. Almost immediately, I was falsely accused of stealing. Rumors tend to grow and multiply. One rumor grew into many until it touched every part of my life. Things only became worse and in time, it was whispered that I was a sexual predator. This originated in a ward council meeting. I confirmed this with my bishop and learned that it was he who introduced the subject.\\nIn 2014, when I ran for the Idaho State legislature, these rumors were leveraged against me. I lost that race, but the loss was most significant inside the boundaries of the American Falls Stake where these rumors reduced my name and standing to the lowest level.\\nThis year, another man ran against that same legislator. On that legislator’s Facebook page, members of my ward and stake used all manner of lies to create an imaginary friendship between myself and this man. They actively applied every rumor and every hate they feel for me to this man. A massive print and digital campaign was launched across the stake. Printed cards and text messages made it to virtually every home. The message simply informed the people that I and this other man are friends and asked if the people had had enough. The objective was to apply the false allegations and hate that were once directed to me alone, to this man as well. In the end, he lost his race by a small number of votes. Many who call me brother on Sunday used me as a wrecking ball to destroy the reputation and good standing of a man I barely know. This, for me, was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\\nWith the background in place, I will address the matter at hand.\\nI am a columnist for the Idaho State Journal. I write about my passions which are faith, family, and the constitutional principles of liberty. Conventional wisdom dictates that civil people never talk about religion or politics. However, I have three great treasures. First is the restored gospel. Second are the men who wrote the founding documents that created a free land where the church could be restored. Third is my family that lives free because of the founding documents and are sealed to me because of the restored Gospel. I feel driven to boldly speak for these truths. I understand that since these are “forbidden topics”, virtually everything I write will be embraced by some and rejected by others.\\nI know that even truth can be spoken with a spirit that hides all truth and offends good men. I know that the evil men find the truth to be hard and offensive. It has been difficult for me to present challenging topics that balance these two realities. I am at times, less than perfect and cause offense where none is intended.\\nBishop Bart Ralphs of the Rockland Idaho Ward, inherited a large farm which he does not farm. Instead, it is primarily enrolled in the CRP program, a farm subsidy.\\nIn the summer of 2015, I wrote a column entitled, “CRP, The Criminal Restoration Policy”. I supported that work with the Constitution and the words of Ezra Taft Benson. As a result, I was called into the office of Bishop Ralphs and told that I could “never involve the church again” or I would lose my Temple Recommend. I questioned that demand and it was confirmed to me that I was to never speak, teach, or write about my faith again.\\nAfter careful consideration, I came to recognize that this demand deprived me of free agency, a key and essential gift that makes exaltation possible. It also violated a God-given right that is codified in the First Amendment and which cannot be expanded or contracted by men or government. In a Facebook private message, I relayed my feelings to my Bishop. He responded by unfriending me. There was no other reply.\\nA month later, I wrote and published “The Forgotten Prophet” (attached). On the Sunday it appeared in print, my Temple Recommend was taken. In that meeting with Bishop Ralphs, I became angry and said some things that I later came to regret. In that same meeting, Bishop informed me that he was no longer my friend.\\nA few days later, on September 18, 2015, I mailed Bishop Ralphs an apology for becoming angry (attached). There was no reply for many months.\\nI argued successfully, I think, that my free agency, freedom of conscience and my first amendment rights had been violated. Though this has never been admitted, I believe it is true because no one has since demanded that I remain silent regarding my faith. Instead, I have faced a continuous volley of new accusations.\\nIn September of 2015, Mindy, my dear wife, and I began traveling an hour to attend church outside of the American Falls Stake. We desperately needed to be in a place where we can worship the Prince of Peace in a place of peace. We met with Bishop Paul Bitton and Stake President Dye about moving our records to the Chubbuck Idaho 6th ward. President Dye and Bishop Bitton sought council from their regional leader and scheduled a meeting with Bishop Ralphs and President Lovell. Bishop Bitton later reported to me that he and President Dye used all their influence to convince Bishop Ralphs and President Lovell that they had overstepped their appropriate priesthood authority by attempting to quash freedom of conscience, agency, speech and expression. In the end, Bishop Ralphs and President Lovell would not be persuaded.\\nOn October 25, 2015, Mindy and I met with Stake President Garn Lovell and his councilor Larry Lankford. This meeting was immediately adversarial. President Lovell, for over an hour, repeatedly accused me of speaking for the church in my columns. I boldly denied every accusation. I also stated that if there was a column that he was concerned about, we should read and discuss it and if I was found to be in the wrong, I would accept the consequences. He stated again and again that he had the offending columns in his possession but he refused to show me or even identify them. To this day, I have no understanding of his accusations.\\nFinally, President Lovell accused me of a future sin. He stated that he fully expected to see the details of our meeting in my next column. This was very offensive. I am a serious and principled columnist. I have never and will never publish confidential or off the record information. In this single statement, President Lovell attacked my character, my integrity and my honor.\\nMindy is the least confrontational person I know. She is slow to anger and quick to bite her tongue. I was shocked when she looked President Lovell in the eye and stated, “that was completely inappropriate”. Then she stood and walked out the door. I said, “shame on you” and followed my wife.\\nIn this matter, I do feel serious regret for two actions taken. First, I regret having become angry on the day my Temple Recommend was taken. Second, some months after my recommend was taken, there was a group attack on the Rockland Facebook page. This was one of many that have occurred in social media. In response, I published a column that was driven by anger. Anger is never acceptable. As indicated above, I did write an apology to Bishop Ralphs. Since my angry response to the community was in the form of a column, I publicly admitted my guilt and apologized in my next column, What Manner of Man, (attached).\\nOn February 9, 2016, Mindy and I met with Bishop Ralphs and Bishop Bitton. Bishop Ralphs opened the meeting by introducing a new accusation. He stated that I had been critical of you, the general authorities. I boldly and forcefully denied that accusation. Bishop Ralphs immediately dropped that point and has never spoken of it since. On February 18, I sent a follow-up letter to Bishop Ralphs, (attached).\\nOn March 7, 2016, Bishop Ralphs and his first counselor, Keith Miller met with me in my home. At that time, Bishop Ralphs did apologize for multiple occasions when he stated that he was not my friend. I frankly accepted his apology. Then, he stated that he was ready to accept my written apology of six months earlier. Then he criticized and condemned my apology to him and my apology to the community as being inadequate. The message seems unclear when a man simultaneously accepts and rejects an apology.\\nIn this meeting, I asked Bishop Ralphs if he would tell me of what I am accused. It was agreed that he would provide a list of written charges. It has been over 100 days and still no answer has been provided. I don’t know if one of the previous accusations apply to me or if some future accusation will be applied.\\nRelations are equally difficult with the counselors in the Bishopric.\\nIn the summer of 2015, I wrote, on a Rockland Facebook group page, about the power of the people and described an incident where the rights of one Idaho man had been protected by people who stood together on principle, loving their neighbor as themselves. I was a key player in this event so I had first hand knowledge. First counselor, Keith Miller, weighed in and told the community that I was deceiving them and that the events I described could not have occurred. In the end, the discussion turned to another personal attack against me by nearly 30 adults from my ward. It is interesting to note that several of the major news networks picked up the story and related it exactly as I had.\\nSecond Councilor Ladd Permann called me some months ago. He was angry over something I had written. I assured him that I was willing to speak with him on the matter, but not over the phone and not over the Internet. Things tend to spin out of control when men do not look each other in the eye, so I offered to meet when and where he chose. He stated that he would call me back to schedule a time. I never heard from him again so I reached out a couple of times. While watching the spring, 2016 General Conference, my thoughts turned to Ladd. I sent him a Facebook message. The message follows, “I continue to feel bad that you continue to refuse to speak with me. Silence will only make things worse and more difficult. At the recent school concert, I sadly watched as you locked your eyes to the floor as you passed me. You do the same when you ignore my messages and phone calls. However, honest communication heals. Let it begin with us.” Facebook reported that he saw it within minutes. He never replied.\\nOn these shifting sands, I cannot get my footing. I am currently a man without a ward, without a church. My heart is broken, never could I have imagined this happening to me. But still, I have my faith, my religion and my unmovable testimony of the reality and majesty of my Lord and Savior.\\nI have been offered an opportunity to regain my Temple Recommend. However, it requires that I bear false witness, that I lie. This I cannot do. I would ask, what power does the temple have to save if I gain entry with a lie?\\nUp until now, I have been satisfied to prayerfully wait on the Lord. However, when the people used me as a tool to harm another, I was compelled to action.\\nI know what the Gospel of Jesus Christ is. I know that above all, it is about standing firm and resolute in the face of evil. I know that it is about truth and principle and loving my neighbor. Most of all, I know that it is about following my Savior as best I can. My testimony of him is secure and I have endeavored to keep every covenant. I will never turn from this.\\nI moved my family to Idaho, literally on the run from a Tacoma gang.\\nMy family endured a season of violence and fear. I cannot describe what it was like to use a car to stop a man with a gun or how it felt to leave him down and broken in the street. But there was hope in that because I was still able to do something. I can’t describe what it was like, just before retiring to bed, to jamb a fork between the top of every door and the door frame and hang a pot on it so that it would fall and warn us if evil men entered our home. But, there was reassurance in that, it was something that I could do. I can’t describe what it feels like to drive an invader from my home with a gun or struggle to stop my voice from shaking for an hour afterward, but at least I was not left helpless and defenseless. I can’t describe what it was like to stand at one end of the hall, gun in hand, while my wife tore our five young children from their beds, pushed then to the floor and covered them with her own body, but at least we could do something.\\nDuring that terrible season, I awoke many times during the night to slip my hand under my pillow and touch a loaded pistol. There was an odd sort of peace in confirming again and again that it was there.\\nBut this season of violence was not all bad. It all began when our thirteen year old daughter, Jenny, began to walk a dark path. She was running with these gang members, disappearing sometimes for days at a time. One evening, I was talking with my Mother about our troubles. She offered great and wise council. She reminded me of the brother of Jared, how he had approached the Lord with a plan. Mom told me to stop leaving everything to the Lord, to get a plan and take it to him.\\nI shared this with my wife. Daily, we prayed that Jenny would see the evil of these people, that she would see and fear their violence, that she would be in danger, that she would be protected, and that she would turn away from sin. The first attack came on the third day.\\nThrough it all, we could clearly see the hand of the Lord. Though there was property damage, we were never harmed. Though the odds were at times, twelve to one, we were protected. Though we could not see them, those that were with us were greater than those that were with them. Of most importance, the Lord granted everything we asked… in ways that we never imagined. Jenny turned away from that dark and evil path.\\nToday, Jenny is a good wife and mother of four grandchildren that we dearly love. She is a neonatal nurse in Boise. Every day she saves the children of other parents who are praying for a miracle. She often speaks with such love and tenderness about the tiny lives that rely entirely on her gentle care. I always reflect and offer a silent prayer of gratitude. Jenny saves the children of other families who cannot help themselves because a loving Father in Heaven extended his mighty arm and pulled her back when I and my wife were powerless to do so.\\nI once believed that my season of fear and violence would be the hardest thing I would be asked to endure. I was desperately wrong. These current troubles rob me of my sleep. When I figuratively slide my hand under my pillow, there is nothing there except hopelessness. I remain prayerful and determined to do what is right.\\nI have come to know and love Helmuth Hübener, a young Mormon boy of incredible courage. I think I understand what troubled him most on the day he was executed in Nazi Germany.\\nAt this time, I respectfully and prayerfully request one of the following. First, that our records be moved to a ward where we can worship in peace. Or second, that a church court be immediately convened wherein I will be formally charged with specific allegations that I can understand and address.\\nSincerely,\\nBrother Lance Earl',\n",

       "  'Here are some tips to avoid drama at your work holiday party.\\nYour holiday party at work is a good chance to loosen up a little. But it’s a fine line, especially when you add alcohol to the mix. So here are seven tips to help you out…\\n1. Don’t skip the party unless you absolutely have to. Stick around for at least 30 minutes before you take off.\\n2. Don’t go on an empty stomach. Make sure there’s some food in there to soak up the alcohol so you don’t get too drunk. The appetizers they serve might not be enough.\\n3. Don’t avoid work topics, but don’t focus on work either. It’s the one thing everyone has in common, so it usually comes up in conversation. Just don’t focus on work or go in with an agenda, like asking your boss about that raise you’re expecting.\\n4. Be sensitive to other religions. Your work party isn’t a good time to take a hard stance on things like saying “Merry Christmas” instead of “Happy Holidays.”\\n5. Don’t dance romantically with a co-worker unless your boss already knows you’re together. A lot of people think their holiday party is a great place to finally make a move on someone. It’s NOT.\\n6. Don’t be the last one to leave. Especially if you drink a lot. Even if you’re not the drunkest, you’ll LOOK like the biggest partier if you’re the last one there.\\n7. Never go to a third venue. If you’re sober and people are hitting a bar afterward, go for it. But a SECOND bar is risky. By that point, you’re definitely drunk. And it might not be the official party anymore, but you’re still with co-workers.\\nClick Here to see more.',\n",
       "  'The San Antonio Spurs beat up the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night to take a 2-0 lead in their series. Gregg Popovich’s side is clearly better and the outcome of this matchup seems inevitable. Perhaps that’s why Grizzlies assistant coach David Fizdale is so fired up by the unfair whistle he believes his team received.\\nFizdale went on a ferocious rant during his postgame press session, ripping the officials for being unacceptably unprofessional.\\nHere’s the whole, unfiltered speech:\\n‘It’s unfortunate that I’ve got a guy like Mike Conley, who in his whole career’s got zero technical fouls. And just cannot seem to get the proper respect from the officials that he deserves. It was a very poorly officiated basketball game. Zach Randolph, the most rugged guy in the game, had zero free throws, but somehow Kawhi Leonard had 19 free throws. First half we shot 19 shots in the paint and we had six free throws. They shot 11 times in the paint and had 23 free throws. Not a numbers guy, but that doesn’t seem to add up. Overall, 35 times we shot the ball in the paint, we had 15 free throws for the game. They shot 18 times in the paint and had 32 free throws, Kawhi shot more free throws than our whole team. Explain it to me. We don’t get the respect that these guys deserve, because Mike Conley doesn’t go crazy, he has class, and he just plays the game, but I’m not gonna let them treat us that way. I know Pop’s got pedigree, and I’m a young rookie, but they not gonna rook us! That’s unacceptable, that was unprofessional. Our guys dug in that game and earned the right to be in that game, and they did not even give us a chance. Take that for data!\\nFizdale then slammed his fist on the table and left dramatically. Guy knows how to make an exit.\\nIt’s difficult to decide if “they not gonna rook us” or “take that for data” is the more iconic line. Time will tell.\\nThe Spurs went 31-for-32 at the free-throw line. The Grizzlies went 13-for-15. And it truly is remarkable that Z-Bo didn’t get to the charity stripe a single time.\\nFizdale surely has a fine headed his way. On the bright side, he got his money’s worth.',\n",
       "  'MIAMI (AP) – Officials were so concerned about the mental stability of the student accused of last month\\'s Florida school massacre that they decided he should be forcibly committed.\\nBut the recommendation was never acted upon.\\nA commitment under the law would have made it more difficult if not impossible for Nikolas Cruz to obtain a gun legally.\\nCruz is accused of the shooting rampage that killed 14 students and three school employees at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14. In addition, 17 people were wounded.\\nBut more than a year earlier, documents in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz and obtained by The Associated Press show school officials and a sheriff\\'s deputy recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation.\\nThe documents, which are part of Cruz\\'s criminal case in the shooting, show that he had written the word \"kill\" in a notebook, told a classmate that he wanted to buy a gun and use it, and had cut his arm supposedly in anger because he had broken up with a girlfriend. He also told another student he had drunk gasoline and was throwing up. Calls had even been made to the FBI about the possibility of Cruz using a gun at school.\\nThe documents were provided by a psychological assessment service initiated by Cruz\\'s mother called Henderson Behavioral Health. The documents show a high school resource officer who was also a sheriff\\'s deputy and two school counselors recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be committed for mental evaluation under Florida\\'s Baker Act. That law allows for involuntary commitment for mental health examination for at least three days.\\nSuch an involuntary commitment would also have been a high obstacle if not a complete barrier to legally obtaining a firearm, such as the AR-15 rifle used in the Stoneman Douglas massacre on Feb. 14, authorities say.\\nThere is no evidence Cruz was ever committed. Coincidentally, the school resource officer who recommended that Cruz be \"Baker Acted\" was Scot Peterson – the same Broward Sheriff\\'s Office deputy who resigned amid accusations he failed to respond to the shooting by staying outside the building where the killings occurred.\\nDavid S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, said that an involuntary commitment would have been a huge red flag had Cruz attempted to buy a firearm legally.',\n",

       "  '‘I was prepared for yesterday. I had gone through the motions of having my son die like this’\\nMounties investigate Jan. 31 at Broadway and Cedar avenues in Chilliwack after Cody Isaacson was killed inside. (Paul Henderson/ The Progress)\\nCody Isaacson’s father David wasn’t surprised to learn his son died in a hail of bullets in his Chilliwack home early morning on Jan. 31.\\nHeartbroken at the loss, certainly. Angry at the devastating effects of illicit street drugs, indeed.\\nBut most of all, David is frustrated at a perceived lack of investigative work done by the RCMP to solve crimes involving those in the drug underworld.\\n“I anticipated this happening,” David Isaacson told The Progress in an interview a day after his son was killed when at least a dozen bullets were fired at the known drug house Cody worked out of at the corner of Broadway and Cedar avenues.\\n• READ MORE: IHIT investigating fatal shooting in Chilliwack\\n“I was prepared for yesterday. I had gone through the motions of having my son die like this.”\\nChilliwack’s first homicide of the year happened just after 6 a.m. at the house at 9291 Broadway Ave. Neighbours reported hearing between six and eight shots fired at the time, although as many as a dozen bullet holes were visible in the front door and wall of the bright yellow house. Each hole marked with a letter, “A” through to “L” labelled by RCMP forensics investigators.\\nAt a press conference at the scene Wednesday afternoon, IHIT spokesperson Cpl. Frank Jang confirmed 28-year-old Cody Isaacson was the victim of the brazen killing, a person known to Chilliwack RCMP.\\nBut as yet police have not yet confirmed that Cody was also the victim of a home invasion at a house on Second Avenue on Oct. 25, 2017. The Progress has learned he was indeed in that house along with his girlfriend when a number of individuals wearing masks stormed in with guns and hammers.\\nReports are that three shots were fired, none striking anyone, although David Isaacson insists Cody suffered injuries to his face from hammer blows before he took a machete away from an attacker and fought back.\\n• READ MORE: Chilliwack RCMP investigating possible home invasion\\nAsked to connect the October home invasion with the Jan. 31 homicide, Cpl. Jang said IHIT investigators will be working with the local RCMP Serious Crimes Unit to make connections between other incidents.\\nA frustrated father, David insists police were aware of who was involved in the home invasion but did little to investigate it, something he thinks might have prevented Cody’s death on Jan. 31.\\n“I knew something bad was going to happen to Cody,” he said. “Let’s face it, when you are in that lifestyle you make a lot of enemies. But the police did no investigation from the earlier home invasion. They know who did it.”\\nStill, he says IHIT told him on Jan. 31 “they want to solve this,” and a friend told him Cody’s photo was posted on SkyTrain in Metro Vancouver with the RCMP looking for tips.\\nAnd while David speaks highly of his recently murdered son, he understands the “business” and insists that in the context of the underground drug world, Cody was one of the good guys.\\n”He took good care of his crew,” David said. “Nobody has anything bad to say about him. He was always the person to give something. I am kind compassionate to others, and Cody was the same way.”\\nCody does not have any local criminal contacts according to Court Services Online, not surprising to his father who said he unfortunately only got into dealing last summer.\\nHe does, however, have a history in the north. Upon his murder, the Prince George Citizen went with the headline: “Former Prince George drug dealer shot to death in Chilliwack,” pointing to his 2014 conviction for weapons and drug possession leading to a 442-day sentence in jail.\\nThe Citizen reports he was arrested twice within three weeks at the same Jasper Street home.\\n“On both occasions, police found enough crack cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine to suggest it was used to supply drugs to lower-level drug houses around the city,” according to Citizen reporter Mark Nielsen.\\nStill, even here, father David comes to his son’s defence saying that Cody wasn’t at home when the drugs and weapons were found, his girlfriend was, so he could have walked away.\\n“He manned up because she was home, not because he had to, but he did,” David said. “Cody was a man when it came to doing the right thing, and that has made him some enemies.”\\nDavid hoped, though, that Cody would leave the world, something that nearly destroyed his own life. A recovering meth addict himself, David says he turned Cody on to his relatively new faith in Jesus and he thought Cody was doing well.\\nBut meth is a stubborn foe.\\n“The crystal meth is a really, really bad drug. It destroys everything that gets in its path. It happened to us.”\\nIn a wide-ranging interview on Feb. 1, David seemed remarkably calm about what happened, something he attributed to his faith, but he also was a little conflicted on what to do next, admitting he may have still been in shock.\\nTold by someone via text the night of the killing that the Red Scorpions gang were in town and he needed to flee, his defiant response: “I’m not going anywhere.”\\nUpon further reflection of his goals pursuing his woodworking, his religion and moving on with his life, now with the death of his son, David switched gears.\\n“Cody was a good kid,” he said, getting emotional for the first time, suggesting that maybe it was soon time for him to leave the Fraser Valley.\\n“There’s nothing for me here anymore.”\\nCody Isaacson leaves behind three children.\\n@PeeJayAitch\\npaul.henderson@theprogress.com\\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.',\n",
       "  'Pope Francis, the supposedly kinder and gentler Pope, blasted transgender people during a speech yesterday, describing gender confirmation surgery “manipulation” and a “choice.”\\n“The biological and psychical manipulation of sexual difference, which biomedical technology allows us to perceive as completely available to free choice — which it is not! — thus risks dismantling the source of energy that nurtures the alliance between man and woman and which renders it creative and fruitful,” the Pope told the Pontifical Academy for Life’s general assembly.\\n“Pope Francis’s statement denouncing technologies that support gender confirmation demonstrates the pontiff’s tragic ignorance on the challenges faced by transgender people, and puts this population at risk of increased discrimination and violence,” said Marianne Duddy-Burke, Executive Director of DignityUSA, a group for LGBT Catholics.\\n“The reality is that transgender people experience tremendous stress in trying to live as who the world believes them to be. It takes incredible strength and commitment for them to risk living as who they are. Not all transgender people can or want to access technological supports that confirm their true genders. Throughout history, we have seen our transgender neighbors use whatever tools are available to live in their truth. Technology that makes this easier should be embraced as a blessing.”\\nDuring his papacy, Pope Francis has attacked gender confirmation surgery before, but has also met with a transgender man who was rejected by his local church. He has also had lunch with gay and transgender prisoners.\\nIn 2016, he said Jesus would never turn away transgender faithful and that priests today should accompany them spiritually, even if they undergo sex change operations, sin and repent.\\n“These people must be accompanied as Jesus accompanied them,” he said.\\nFrancis drew a firm distinction at the time between the need for priests to minister to transgender Catholics and what he called the “nasty” tendency of schools to “indoctrinate” children with the idea that their gender is something that can be picked and chosen and changed.\\n“It’s one thing if a person has this tendency and also changes sex. It’s another thing to teach this in school to change mentalities. This is what I call ‘ideological colonization,’” Francis said.\\nThis Story Filed Under',\n",

Go get 'em.\\nThe octopus at Sassetta. Alison McLean\\nFor the sophisticate\\nIn the late afternoon, stop by Design District museum Dallas Contemporary (161 Glass St.) to take in one of their whimsical and edgy exhibits of sculpture, photography and paintings. A recent favorite, Pia Camil, sewed together second-hand T-shirts from Mexican markets to create interactive fabric sculptures the size of parachutes. The shirts' neck holes begged for onlookers to poke their heads through and experience the installation from the other side.\\nWhen the museum closes at 6 p.m., drive to nearby Italian restaurant Sassetta (1617 Hi Line Drive, Suite 390) for an early dinner. Order an arugula, mushroom and shaved Parmesan salad with lemon vinaigrette and one of their pizzas. They have a crisp, bubbly thin crust. Complement your meal with a bottle of wine from an all-Italian wine list loaded with interesting varietals and neat bargains.\\nSarah Schumacher\\nFor the laid-back art lover\\nMeet one weekday afternoon at the Museum of Geometric and MADI Art in Uptown (3109 Carlisle St.), an off-the-map, quirky, small museum dedicated to midcentury geometric moving sculpture. The artform has its origins in Buenos Aires in the 1940s. Dallasites Dorothy and Bill Masterson opened their personal collection to the public in 2003, and you can see it for an optional donation. The museum also has rotating shows.\\nRelated Stories Best of Dallas 2017\\nWhen you've taken in the fairly small museum, make the seven minute walk to enjoy Dallas' best happy hour at The Standard Pour (2900 McKinney Ave.) This Uptown food, drink and nightlife mainstay has seasonal cocktail menus and intriguing new flavors. During the happy hour, from 4 to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, many drinks are just $5. Oh, and it offers some of the food from its scratch kitchen for the same low price.\\nRavinder Singh Kathy Tran\\nFor the health-conscious\\nGrab dinner at HG Sply Co. (2008 Greenville Ave.), which offers clean eats that still feel indulgent. Whether you're paleo, vegetarian or slogging through your first Whole30, HG can accommodate.\\nWhen you've finished, walk across the street to Rapscallion (2023 Greenville Ave.) and order a cocktail or two from Dallas' best bartender, Ravinder Singh. The weekly tiki night created at Rapscallion became so popular that Singh rebuilt the menu to focus largely on tiki-inspired drinks, putting Rapscallion at the forefront of the tiki movement that finally took hold in Dallas this year.\\nArmoury D.E. Rico DeLeon\\nFor the music lover\\nStart your evening with a few tacos at Dallas' best new restaurant, Revolver Taco (2701 Main St.). The Fort Worth taqueria opened its first Dallas' location in Deep Ellum this year, and it's setting the bar high. Dine in the more casual front room and order tacos filled with octopus and fried leeks, and frog legs tossed in Thai curry paste.\\nAfterward, catch a show at Armoury D.E.

You'll see up-and-coming local bands like Polystarra and buzzy national acts like A Giant Dog, all on one stage.\\nOnce the last notes have rung out, walk down the street to Dallas' best new bar, Hide (2816 Elm St.). While the bar uses chemistry-heavy drink prep, most of the necessary equipment — such as centrifuges, roto-vaporizers and lasers — is kept in the back to prevent it from coming off as gimmicky. The bar has an impressive selection of prebottled cocktails, and carbonates others right in front of you.\\nEXPAND Strangeways Scott Reitz\\nFor the beer snob\\nShopping at Shake Rag Music Store (4112 Live Oak St.) is more like attending a music nerd's estate sale than visiting a traditional record shop. Meet there late one afternoon, and browse through crates full of records at reasonable prices, as well as just about any kind of music equipment or memorabilia you can imagine, from amps to guitars, clothes, record players, old concert posters and more.\\nWhen you've spent your allowance, drive to nearby Strangeways (2429 N Fitzhugh Ave.) to sample a few brews from their well-curated selection. Strangeways is a bit of a dive compared with the city's other craft beer heavy-hitters, but this underdog should not be underestimated. Visit is during one of its epic themed weeks, like Sour Week, if you can.\\nHannah Ridings\\nFor the old-school\\nWhen a restaurant makes just one thing, that thing better be damn good. And at Rice Chicken (2558 Royal Lane), it is. The fried chicken is perfectly crisp, the almost crunchy batter covering ever-so-juicy, tender meat — indulgent but not the least bit greasy. Order the drumstick sampler and choose your glaze: sweet and spicy or honey-garlic sauce.\\nYou'll want a pitcher of beer and a good stretch when you're done, and USA Bowl at 10920 Composite Drive can offer both.While some Dallas bowling haunts have become more club than alley, with wait times and prices to match, USA Bowl's four dozen lanes stick out for their simplicity.\",\n",

       "  'CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) — An Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history was charged Friday with manufacturing armor-piercing bullets, according to court documents obtained by The Associated Press.\\nUnfired armor-piercing bullets found inside the Las Vegas hotel room where the attack was launched on Oct. 1 contained the fingerprints of ammunition dealer Douglas Haig of Arizona, according to the complaint filed in federal court in Phoenix. It says Haig didn’t have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition.\\nThe records don’t say if the ammunition was used in the attack. Haig was charged shortly before holding a news conference Friday where he said didn’t notice anything suspicious when he sold 720 rounds of ammunition to Stephen Paddock in the weeks before the attack that killed 58 people.\\nHaig, a 55-year-old aerospace engineer who sold ammunition as a hobby for about 25 years, said he met Paddock at a Phoenix gun show in the weeks before the shooting and he was well-dressed and polite.\\nHe didn’t have the quantity of tracer ammunition on hand that Paddock was seeking, so Paddock contacted him a few days later and lined up a sale at Haig’s home in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa. Tracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct.\\nHaig said he was shocked and sickened when a federal agent informed him of the massacre 11 hours after it unfolded.\\n“I had no contribution to what Paddock did,” Haig said, adding that there was nothing unusual about the type or quantity of ammunition Paddock bought. “I had no way to see into his mind.”\\nHaig’s lawyer said they held the news conference in a bid to protect his reputation after he was revealed earlier this week to be a “person of interest” in the investigation. Haig’s identity emerged by mistake after his name was not redacted in court documents.\\nHaig arose in the investigation when a box with his name and address was found in the Mandalay Bay hotel suite where Paddock launched the attack on a music festival below.\\nHe gave the box to Paddock to carry the 720 rounds of tracer ammunition from the sale.\\nHaig said Paddock told him that “he was going to go out to the desert to put on a light show, either with or for his friends. I can’t remember whether he used the word ‘with’ or ‘for.’ But he said that he was going out at night to shoot it with friends.”\\nHe said he has received unwanted media attention and death threats since his name was released. Still, Haig, who has closed his ammunition business, said he doesn’t expect to take any legal action as a result of his name being publicly revealed.\\nThe Las Vegas Police Department and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives declined to comment when contacted earlier Friday.\\nThe FBI and U.S. attorney’s office in Nevada didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.',\n",
       "  'An Arcadia woman faces murder charges in connection to a house fire where three children were found dead and a grandfather was seriously injured.\\nAn Arcadia woman faces murder charges in connection to a house fire where three children were found dead and a grandfather was seriously injured.\\nThe woman accused of starting a deadly fire that killed three boys appeared in court on Sunday morning.\\nThe woman accused of starting a deadly fire that killed three boys appeared in court on Sunday morning.\\nA family out of Arcadia was ripped apart by tragedy Saturday.\\nThree brothers – the youngest only 4 years old – were killed in a house fire that investigators say was set on purpose.\\nThe home belongs to the boys\\' grandfather but his ex-girlfriend is accused of setting the fire.\\nNot only is the family impacted by the loss, but the community as well.\\nAll day Monday, neighbors and others visited the site where the home used to be to drop off balloons, cards and stuffed animals in remembrance of the three boys who were always smiling.\\n\"Just to see the smile on their faces, I\\'m going to miss that. I\\'m going to miss that,\" said Gene Smith, the uncle. \"Our children are supposed to bury us. We ain\\'t suppose to bury our children.\"\\nAt just ages 10, 8 and 4, brothers Marcus, Kiani, and Kemaren lost their lives as their grandfather\\'s home burned.\\nArcadia police believe the grandfather\\'s girlfriend, 49-year-old Marian Williams, set the home on fire early Saturday morning.\\n\"She is just one cold-hearted person, it\\'s just like these kids did not deserve this,\" said Dianetta Binja, a family friend.\\nThe grandfather and another woman were able to escape the home.\\nTeachers, friends, and community members can just remember the boys who always wore a smile.\\n\"He did his work, and he loved hugs,\" said Ava Fabila, a classmate.\\n\"It\\'s going to be real hard for those teachers when they do attendance when they have to cross that name off the list and it\\'s final, it\\'s going to be very very difficult,\" said Robin Fabila, a teacher assistant.\\nFamily members told us the boy\\'s mother is still in shock from what happened to her young children.\\n\"She\\'s grieving real hard, but like I said, I\\'m here for them through this all even when it\\'s over, I\\'m still here for them,\" Binja said.\\nAs the community continues to grieve through the tragedy, the boys have brought them closer together.\\nFamily members told us the grandfather is out of the intensive care unit and is in stable condition, suffering from burns to his arms and face.\\nWith a criminal past, why was she not behind bars?\\nBefore she was arrested in connection to a deadly fire Saturday morning, Marian Williams had been to jail many times before.\\n\"She doesn\\'t mind getting into trouble,\" said Towanda Shaw of Arcadia.\\n\"I know for a fact that we\\'ve arrested her a couple times at this particular residence right here where the arson was committed,\" said Arcadia City Marshall Matt Anderson.\\nAccording to Florida Department of Correction records, Williams has been incarcerated seven different times over 12 felonies.\\n\"She\\'s kind of the definition of a career criminal,\" said Spencer Cordell, criminal defense attorney.\\nWilliams was last released by the DOC in 2012, but she\\'s been to county jails several times since.\\nIn 2012, she was arrested for felony battery. She had already been convicted of multiple batteries, and had she been convicted of this one, Cordell says she could have faced up to a decade in prison.\\n\"If they had proven that she was a habitual offender, they could have given her up to 10 years,\" Cordell said.\\nBut prosecutor notes obtained by NBC2 Investigators show the state attorney\\'s office decided not to pursue the case because of the evidence. A witness told prosecutors that Williams only lashed out at the victim in order to defend her daughter.\\n\"The prosecutor looked at the case and said she wasn\\'t the aggressor on that one,\" Cordell said.\\nWilliams was arrested several more times in Desoto County.\\nIn December 2016, she was arrested for breaking out the windows at the house she eventually set fire to. The owner, and grandfather of the children who died in the fire, decided not to pursue charges, according prosecutor notes obtained by NBC2 Investigators.\\nMost recently, she was arrested for breaking into the house less than 24 hours before she set fire to it.\\nWe also found several cases in Polk County where Williams avoided major jail time.\\nShe was sentenced to 180 days in jail for a criminal traffic offense in 2015. She was also arrested for felony drug possession in 2015, but court records show the drug charges were dropped.'],\n",

      "[0.9403773574771042, 0.05962263293107013]\n",
      "-Anon. ANSWER: 'Atelectasis' (Greek for 'imperfect extension') means that an area of the lung is not properly inflated, so it is not helping exchange gasses.\n",

      "The hole in the diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen, and which is the primary muscle of breathing) where the esophagus passes through is called the diaphragmatic hiatus.

      "This is a hiatal hernia. There's only so much room in the chest, so the stomach's presence there certainly will collapse part of the lung.\n",

      "The reason this may need to be corrected is not because of the lung — most people have tremendous lung reserves and will do fine without one or two lobes of the lung, or even an entire lung; rather, the stomach can bleed or twist inside the chest, and that's an emergency. You need to talk to your surgeon or regular doctor about the hiatal hernia.\n",
